    ;; Commented out example here, it will only work if you give the role of the lambda
    ;; the right AWS permissions.

    ;; That said - if you are running in a repl it will pick up your local AWS credentials
    ;; and you could try it out

    (go (let [kms-client (aws/new-kms-client "ap-southeast-2")
              s3-client  (aws/new-s3-client)
              config     (<! (config/resolve-config kms-client))]

          (println "Resolved Config:" config)

          (callback js/undefined (aws-async/list-bucket-names s3-client))))
